## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styling
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For animations

### What I Learned

While working on this project, I improved my knowledge of responsive design and state management in React. Below are some key takeaways:

```html
<h1>Responsive Heading Example</h1>
```

```css
.responsive-container {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

```js
const handleSubmit = (event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  console.log("Form submitted!");
};
```

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus more on:

- Improving accessibility best practices
- Enhancing animations using Framer Motion for better user experience

### Useful Resources

- [CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped me structure the layout efficiently.
- [MDN Web Docs - Form Validation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Form_validation) - Useful for handling form validation.
- [Framer Motion Docs](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Helped me implement smooth animations.
